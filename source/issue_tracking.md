title: Issue Tracking

Hive tracks both bugs and enhancement requests using [Apache JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE). We welcome input, however, before filing a request, please make sure you do the following:

  * Search the JIRA database.
  * Check the [user mailing list](/mailing_lists.html), both by searching the archives and by asking questions.
